#Data Science Tools
```

This table indicates three development environment open source tools used in data science.
|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|Apache Spark| A framework for big data that speeds up data processing. It allows data scientists to perform tasks like data wrangling, transformation, and machine learning. |
|Tensor Flow| A machine learning platform that offers resources for training and building models and recommendation systems. It also allows data scientists to work with artificial intelligence. |
|Scikit-learn|Supports both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It includes algorithms and models for model fitting, selection, and evaluation. |



```python
###Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

```


```python
# Addition
result = 5 + 3
print("Addition:", result)

# Subtraction
result = 10 - 4
print("Subtraction:", result)

# Multiplication
result = 6 * 7
print("Multiplication:", result)

# Division
result = 20 / 5
print("Division:", result)

# Exponentiation
result = 2 ** 3
print("Exponentiation:", result)
```

    Addition: 8
    Subtraction: 6
    Multiplication: 42
    Division: 4.0
    Exponentiation: 8



```python
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
```


```python
# Arithmetic
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print("Arithmetic:", result)
```

    Arithmetic: 17



```python
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
```


```python
# Hours
minutes = 200
hours = minutes/60
print("Hours:", hours)
```

    Hours: 3.3333333333333335
